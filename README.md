Sequence of work ideally is:

1. Importing Datasets
Use the libraries in Python to help you import data from multiple sources.

2. Preprocessing
Perform some fundamental data wrangling tasks that, together, form the pre-processing phase of data analysis. These tasks include handling missing values in data, formatting data to standardize it and make it consistent, normalizing data, grouping data values into bins, and converting categorical variables into numerical quantitative variables.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform computations on the data to calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data. Putting data into groups to visualize the data better, using the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables,using the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them.

4. Model Development
Define the explanatory variable and the response variable and understand the differences between the simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models.Evaluate a model using visualization and learn about polynomial regression and pipelines. Interpret and use the R-squared and the mean square error measures to perform in-sample evaluations to numerically evaluate our model. Prediction and decision making when determining if our model is correct.

5. Model Evaluation
Model evaluation and  different data model refinement techniques. Model selection and how to identify overfitting and underfitting in a predictive model. Using Ridge Regression to regularize and reduce standard errors to prevent overfitting a regression model and using the Grid Search method to tune the hyperparameters of an estimator.
